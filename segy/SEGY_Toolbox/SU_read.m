function [traces,time]=SU_read(filein,varargin)
% traces=SU_read(filein,arguments)
%
% SU_read reads in all or part of the SU file.
%
% Inputs:
%    filein= the name of the SU file that is to be read in.
%
% Outputs:
%    traces= a Trace object.  To get the trace header values use
%       SEGY_getHeader.  To get the trace data values use SEGY_getData.
%
% Optional Arguments 
% To only read in some traces:
%   traces=SU_read(filein,'traces',{search parameters});
%      search parameters can be a series of header words and values as
%          defined in SEGY_getHeader
