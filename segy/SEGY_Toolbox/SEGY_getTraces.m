%
% SEGY_getTraces is a function that allows the user to only read in some of
% the traces.  This is done by comparing value to the traceheader data.
% word must be one of the names defined in the definitions file.  For SEG-Y
% revision 1 standards the word must be one of the following:
%     'tracl','tracr','fldr','tracf','ep','cdp','cdpt','trid','nvs','nhs',
%     'duse','offset','gelev','selev','sdepth','gdel','sdel','swdep',
%     'gwdep','scalel','scalco','sx','sy','gx','gy','counit','wevel',
%     'swevel','sut','gut','sstat','gstat','tstat','laga','lagb','delrt',
%     'muts','mute','ns','dt','gain','igc','igi','corr','sfs','sfe','slen',
%     'styp','stas','stae','tatype','afilf','afils','nofilf','nofils',
%     'lcf','hcf','lcs','hcs','year','day','hour','minute','sec','timbas',
%     'trwf','grnors','grnofr','grnlof','gaps','otrav','cdpx','cdpy',
%     'iline','xline','sp','scalsp','tval','tconstm','tconste','tunit',
%     'devtr','scalt','stypeo','sedm','sede','smmtm','smmte','smmtu',
%     'fbpicks','scalfb';
%
% It is possible to search using multiple words.  An example would be 
%  traces=SEGY_getTraces(tracehead,'gx',1:50,'cdpx',60);  
% this would search for traces that had a x coordinate from 1:50 and has a
% common depth point of 60.
%
% Input:
%  tracehead= can be either a TraceHeader object which can be created by 
%     SEGY_readHeaders or a filename.
%  word= a name defined in the definitions file, SEG-Y Revision 1 Standard
%     words are given above
%  value= a value is either scalar values or numerical arrays
%
% Output:
%  traces= a Trace object.  To get the traceheader values use
%       SEGY_getHeader.  To get the trace data values use SEGY_getData.
